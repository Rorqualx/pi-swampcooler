# pi-swampcooler

This project is a simple swamp cooler controller using a raspberry pi and a 4-relay board.

It should eventually have a web monitoring and possibly web control interface, as well as a touchscreen interface. It will use readings from an outdoor weather station and/or indoor sensors to determine whether the cooler should be run, and notify end users by email/text/audio announcement when windows should be opened to facilitate running.
